Things you will need: A VM with kali linux, BeEF.

1) Once you have your virtual machine with kali linux on it, install BeEF. It's a pain to install but it's worth it. When customising the site, put the redirect to whatever site you want to get the cookies from.
2) Now for the easy part, get the victim to click the link you created or spoofed with BeEF.
3) After they have done that, wait a few seconds on your virtual machine, then click on "commands".
4) Search for "google phishing"
5) On the right the information will show up; login to that, and change the roblox email and password.
