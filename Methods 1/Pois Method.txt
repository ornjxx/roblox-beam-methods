Method 1
So first of all, your cookie logging extension
must be fully functionable [or stub], and you will need
an alt with BC that has a small limited, It
would help a lot more if you have 10k-15k rap,
the more rap you have the easier it will be,
So first you'll need to find a victim, and ask
them to trade, always overpay so they always say
yes, dont send a trade by the way, and before
you trade the items, tell them to give proof its
not poisoned, so you link them your extension or stub they
get it and repeat, if they ask for more info tell them "
This application allows you to find out if your item is clean
or poisoned, I will not trade as I have been banned before due
to trading and recieving a poisoned item."

Also a buyer found out a new way to imporve this, so first say
you are giving away an item and then they send you a trade, ask if
they item is poisoned then tell them there is a extension that tells you
if the item is poisoned, so send the .crx or stub/extension.
