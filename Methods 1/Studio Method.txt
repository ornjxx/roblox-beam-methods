Studio method : 1. Go to trade hangouts or any other game of your taste, and seek for a target. Look for someone with around 40k-100k rap,

if you have 200k rap it highers the success rate, makes it look more believable.

2. Go around trade hangout (or any other game of your taste) saying "can u build, do gfx or script?" paying 15k robux upfront.

3. They say yes and think that they are scamming you, but are really getting scammed themselves.

4. Ask for their discord and add them.

5. Now when have them added  say "okay 1 minute", then say your team create isn't working.

6. Say "can you send me your teamcreate code?" and tell them you'll show them how.

7. By now they are confused, so you tell them to click edit on a game in studio.

8. Once the did so, a notification will pop up asking them if they want to open up ROBLOX.

7. Tell them to press CTRL+SHIFT+J to open up the developer console.

9. Now that they're in the developer console, you tell them to scroll all the way to the bottom and find their "Gamelaunch link".

10. Tell them to copy it and send it to you, if they question it tell them it's a link that allows you to open up the game, since your studio wont let you.

11. Now paste their link in another tab and it'll open ROBLOX studio on their account.

12. Now you go to manange plugins in roblox studio and find plugins.

13. You're now on their account, do whatever you want!

14. Profit??
