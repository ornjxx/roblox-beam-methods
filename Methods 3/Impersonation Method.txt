ok so impersonation basically means you're pretending to be someone you're not. this works best when you're switching from 1 site to another.

1. go on v3rm/youtube (be careful with v3rmies, they can fuck ur life)
or trading discord servers

2. change ur name, status, tag, to look almost identical to a trusted person

3. go up to a random guy or a guy tryna buy sth in marketplace

4. say u wanna buy their shit it or sth

5. if they dont suspect anyth, keep going and if they say to use mm, say u are more trusted than mm and tell them to check who u are (fake).

6. if they suspect, tell them ur acc got logged/termed

7. scam them
